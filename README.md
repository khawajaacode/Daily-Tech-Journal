# Daily Tech Journal ðŸš€  

This is my personal 30-day challenge to grow as a software engineer while keeping my GitHub profile active.  
Every day I commit either a solved coding problem, a script, or a short "Today I Learned" (TIL) note.  

## ðŸ“… Challenge Goals  

- Build consistency by committing daily  
- Strengthen problem-solving with Python and algorithms  
- Document what I learn in tech (ML, GitHub, networking, etc)  
- End up with a repo that shows growth and variety

## ðŸ”‘ How to Use  

- Browse the `problems/` folder for coding solutions  
- Browse the `scripts/` folder for automation & data projects  
- Browse the `notes/` folder for quick concept summaries  

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps  

After completing 30 days, Iâ€™ll extend this into a **100-day challenge** with deeper focus on:  

- Machine Learning projects  
- Data Structures and Algorithms  
- Real-world automation scripts
