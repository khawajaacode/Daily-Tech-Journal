### **Stack**

*   Works on **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle.
    
*   Think of it like a stack of plates: the last plate you put on top is the first one you take off.
    
*   **Main operations:**
    
    *   **push**: add an element on top
        
    *   **pop**: remove the top element
        
    *   **peek/top**: check the top element without removing
        
*   **Examples in real life:** Undo option in editors, function call management in programming.
    

### **Queue**

*   Works on **FIFO** (First In, First Out) principle.
    
*   Think of it like a line at a ticket counter: the first person in line is served first.
    
*   **Main operations:**
    
    *   **enqueue**: add an element at the rear
        
    *   **dequeue**: remove an element from the front
        
    *   **front/peek**: check the first element without removing
        
*   **Examples in real life:** Printer job queue, waiting line at a bank.
    

### **Key Difference**

*   **Stack:** Last element added is the first to come out.
    
*   **Queue:** First element added is the first to come out.
