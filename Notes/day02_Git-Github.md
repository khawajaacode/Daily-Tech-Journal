# What is Git & GitHub  

## üßë‚Äçüíª Git  
Git is a **version control system (VCS)** that lets you track changes in your code.  
Think of it as a timeline for your project where you can move back and forth between versions.  

### Key Features  
- Keeps a history of changes  
- Lets multiple people work on the same project without overwriting each other‚Äôs code  
- Helps manage branches (different versions of the same project)  
- Runs locally on your machine  

### Example Commands  
```bash
git init         # Start a new Git repository
git add file.py  # Stage changes
git commit -m "Message"  # Save changes
git log          # See commit history
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è GitHub

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories.
It lets you share your code with others, collaborate, and back up projects online.

### Key Features

Remote storage for Git repos

Collaboration through pull requests and issues

Contributes to your profile with commits and projects

Adds extra features like Actions (automation), Wiki, and Project boards


## ‚ö° Key Difference

Git = the tool (runs locally)

GitHub = the service (hosts Git repos online)

You can use Git without GitHub, but not GitHub without Git.
