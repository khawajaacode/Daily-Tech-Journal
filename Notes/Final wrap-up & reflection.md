üèÅ Final Wrap-Up & Reflection
-----------------------------

This 30-day challenge has been one of the most rewarding experiences for me as a software engineer in progress. What started as a small goal to stay consistent on GitHub turned into a solid learning streak filled with problem-solving, scripting, and documenting my journey.

Throughout the challenge, I:

-   Strengthened my understanding of Python and core algorithms

-   Built small but practical scripts to automate tasks

-   Learned and documented key concepts from Git, ML, and APIs

-   Improved my workflow with GitHub commits and version control discipline

The biggest takeaway is how much progress can be made with small, daily efforts. Even on busy days, committing *something*---a simple note, a few lines of code, or a solved problem---kept the momentum alive.

Going forward, I plan to continue this habit beyond 30 days by exploring deeper topics in data structures, machine learning, and backend development. This repo will stay as a reminder that growth in tech is all about consistency, curiosity, and showing up every day.
